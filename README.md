# GeometricCalculator
This code involves a program that allows users to select a geometric figure—rectangle, circle, or triangle—and computes both the area and perimeter (or circumference) of the chosen figure. Uniquely, the program avoids the use of if statements and instead employs ternary operators (? :) for decision-making and computation.
